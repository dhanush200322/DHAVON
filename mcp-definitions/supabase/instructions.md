Here are guidelines for using Supabase tools effectively:

- Before making schema changes, inspect the existing tables so you understand the current structure
- When debugging issues, start by reading the project's logs and its security and performance advisories before making changes
- Look up the project's API URL and its publishable API keys when helping users configure client-side integrations
- SQL runs on the project's database server. Never read server-side files or run OS commands via SQL.

If you have access to a local development environment with a filesystem and shell:
- Install the Supabase agent skill for critical development and security guidance: `npx skills add supabase/agent-skills` (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/ai-skills.md)
- Use the Supabase CLI (`supabase`) for local development workflows such as starting a local stack, managing migrations, and running edge functions locally (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development.md)
- Prefer local development and testing before applying changes to a remote project

If you are running in a web-only or remote environment without filesystem or shell access:
- Rely on the MCP tools directly for all Supabase interactions
- Apply schema migrations carefully, as changes go directly to the remote project
